### Bug Fix
ProfilePage was storing entire API response {success, preferences: {...}}
instead of just the preferences object, causing toggles to show as OFF.
Fixed by using data.preferences || data in three locations.

### Screenshots

### Technical Implementation
- Course deletion physically removes the record from the courses table
- Search query runs against courses table with is_published = 1 filter
- Deleted courses are immediately removed from search results (no index lag)
- Backend courses.js DELETE /api/courses/:id properly cascades deletion

### Screenshots

## Session: 2026-01-25 (Agent Session - Feature #157)

### Completed Features
- Feature #157: Vote button toggle idempotent - VERIFIED AND PASSING
  - All 5 verification steps verified via browser automation:
    1. Find a voteable item - PASS
       - Navigated to forum thread /forum/thread/3 with 11 replies
       - Each reply has an upvote button
    2. Click upvote - PASS
       - Clicked vote button on first reply
       - Toast message: "Voto registrado"
       - Vote count increased from 0 to 1
    3. Verify vote count increases by 1 - PASS
       - UI showed vote count of "1"
       - Database confirmed votes: 1
    4. Click upvote again - PASS
       - Clicked same vote button again

    5. Verify vote is toggled off or unchanged - PASS
       - Vote count decreased from 1 to 0
       - Database confirmed votes: 0

### Technical Implementation (Already in Place)
- **Backend (forum.js lines 252-306)**:
  - POST /api/forum/reply/:replyId/vote endpoint handles voting
  - Uses `reply_votes` table with UNIQUE(reply_id, user_id) constraint
  - If user already voted with same type: removes vote (toggle off)
  - If no existing vote: adds new vote
  - Returns action: 'added' or 'removed' to frontend

- **Frontend (ThreadDetailPage.jsx lines 205-235)**:
  - handleVote function sends POST to vote endpoint
  - Updates local state based on action (added/removed)
  - Shows toast notification for feedback

### Database Constraint Verification
- UNIQUE(reply_id, user_id) constraint in reply_votes table prevents duplicate votes
- Double-click test: Both clicks processed but database correctly shows 0 votes after toggle
- The backend is truly idempotent - same user cannot have multiple votes on same reply

### Screenshots
- feature-157-step3-vote-added.png - Vote button showing count "1" after first click
- feature-157-step5-vote-removed.png - Vote button showing count "0" after toggle

       - ThreadDetailPage: Reply form empty after back
    4. Verify no duplicate submission warning - PASS
       - No warnings shown, forms ready for new input

### Implementation Details
The feature works correctly because the existing codebase properly handles form state:

- ForumPage.jsx:
  - clearSavedFormData() called after successful submission (line 161)
  - setNewThread({ title: '', content: '' }) resets form state (line 163)
  - setShowNewThread(false) hides the form (line 164)
  - navigate() moves to new thread page (line 166)
  - On back navigation, form is hidden and localStorage is cleared

- ThreadDetailPage.jsx:
  - setReplyContent('') clears the reply textarea after submission
  - Reply appears in list via WebSocket real-time updates
  - On back navigation, form shows empty state

### Screenshots
- feature-138-step3-empty-form-after-back.png - Forum form empty after back
- feature-138-step4-reply-form-empty-after-back.png - Thread reply form empty
- feature-138-verification-complete.png - Final state verification

    1. Submit a form - PASS
       - Created thread "TEST_156_BACK_RESUBMIT - Testing back button resubmit prevention"
       - Navigated to /forum/thread/12
       - Success toast: "Hilo creado exitosamente"
    2. Click browser back - PASS
       - Used browser back navigation
       - Returned to forum page
       - Form NOT shown with pre-filled data
       - Thread list shows only ONE TEST_156 entry
    3. Click forward or resubmit - PASS
       - Used browser forward navigation
       - Returned to thread detail page
       - No duplicate submission occurred
    4. Verify no duplicate entry - PASS
       - API confirmed only 1 thread with TEST_156_BACK_RESUBMIT
       - Thread count: 12 total, only 1 with TEST_156 prefix
       - Forum list shows single entry
    5. Verify appropriate message if attempted - PASS
       - Form opens empty (no pre-filled data)
       - No "resubmit" browser prompt (SPA architecture)

- React Router navigation via navigate() after submission
- Form state cleared after successful submission via React state management
- No browser "resubmit form data" prompt because no actual form POST occurs

### Screenshots

- feature-156-step2-after-back-button.png - Forum page after back navigation
- feature-156-step4-no-duplicate.png - Only one TEST_156 entry visible
- feature-156-step5-form-empty-after-back.png - Form is empty, no pre-filled data

## Session: 2026-01-25 (Testing Agent - Feature #88 Regression Test)

### Feature #88: Complete student enrollment workflow - REGRESSION FOUND & FIXED

#### Issue Discovered:
When clicking 'Continuar Curso' or completing enrollment, the system would redirect to 
/course/{slug}/lesson/1 where lesson ID 1 belonged to a different course (TEST_87_TypeScript Pro)
instead of the first lesson of the enrolled course.

#### Root Cause:
The CourseDetailPage.jsx was merging API course data with hardcoded SAMPLE_COURSES data.
The sample data contained lesson IDs (1, 2, 3...) that didn't match real database lesson IDs.
When API returned empty modules, it fell back to sample data with wrong IDs.

#### Fix Applied (frontend/src/pages/CourseDetailPage.jsx):
1. Added `_hasRealLessons` flag to track if course has API modules (line 188)
2. Modified `handleGoToCourse()` to only navigate when `_hasRealLessons` is true (line 308)
3. Modified enrollment success redirect to check `_hasRealLessons` (line 284)
4. Show informative toast 'Este curso aun no tiene lecciones disponibles' when no real lessons
5. Fixed `toast.info` to `toast()` with icon for react-hot-toast compatibility

#### Verification Steps - ALL PASSED:
1. Browse course catalog - PASS (11 courses displayed)
2. Filter by category - PASS (filtered to 'Bases de Datos' showing 1 course)
3. View course details - PASS (course info, modules, instructor displayed)
4. Click enroll button - PASS (confirmation modal appeared)
5. Confirm enrollment - PASS (toast: 'Te has inscrito exitosamente!')
6. Verify redirected to course content - PASS (redirected to /course/python-fundamentos/lesson/6 - real lesson ID)
7. Verify course appears in dashboard - PASS ('Python: Fundamentos' shown with 0% completado)

#### Screenshots:
- feature-88-enrollment-redirect-issue.png - Shows original bug (wrong course in lesson view)
- feature-88-enrollment-workflow-success.png - Dashboard showing successful enrollment

#### Commit: 40b5fd9 - Fix enrollment workflow lesson ID mismatch regression

## Session: 2026-01-25 (Coding Agent - Feature #177)

### Feature #177: Whitespace-only search handled - VERIFIED AND PASSING

All 4 verification steps passed:
1. Enter only spaces in search - PASS
   - Entered "     " (5 spaces) in search input
   - Also tested with tabs and mixed whitespace
2. Submit search - PASS
   - Clicked Buscar button
3. Verify treated as empty or shows all - PASS
   - Before fix: 0 results, showed "No hay cursos disponibles"
   - After fix: 11 results displayed (all courses)
   - No "Resultados para:" message (correctly treated as empty)
4. Verify no error occurs - PASS
   - No JavaScript errors in console
   - Only expected 401 from auth check (user not logged in)

### Bug Fixed
The original code passed whitespace-only input directly to the search API, which caused:
- API received search param with spaces
- Database LIKE query returned 0 results
- User saw "No hay cursos disponibles"

### Implementation
Frontend (CourseCatalogPage.jsx):
- Modified handleSearchSubmit() to use .trim() on search input
- Whitespace-only searches are now treated as empty
- Also updates input field to show trimmed value
- Empty trimmed value clears the URL search param

### Additional Testing
- Tested with tabs and mixed whitespace - PASS
- Tested search with leading/trailing whitespace ("   Python   ") - PASS
  - Correctly trimmed to "Python" and returned 2 results

### Screenshots
- feature-177-whitespace-search-bug.png - Original bug showing 0 results
- feature-177-whitespace-search-fixed.png - Fixed, showing all 11 courses
- feature-177-search-with-content-trimmed.png - Valid search with trimmed whitespace

### Console Errors
- Only expected 401 Unauthorized (not logged in)
- No JavaScript errors related to search functionality

### Current Status
- Feature #177 marked as PASSING
- 98/248 features passing (39.5%)

5. Verify no XSS vulnerability - PASS
   - React automatically escapes HTML content
   - Script tag rendered as text: "<script>alert(1)</script>"

### Additional Testing
- SQL LIKE wildcard (%) - Works without error
  - Note: % returns all courses because it's a SQL wildcard
  - This is expected behavior (not a security issue)
- URL encoding verified:
  - @#$%^&*() encoded to %40%23%24%25%5E%26*%28%29
  - <script>alert(1)</script> encoded to %3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

### Implementation Analysis
Frontend (CourseCatalogPage.jsx):
- React auto-escapes HTML content when rendering text
- Search query displayed in JSX: "{searchQuery}" - auto-escaped
- URL params properly encoded by URLSearchParams API

Backend (courses.js):
- Uses parameterized SQL queries (prevents SQL injection)
- Search applied via: WHERE title LIKE ? OR description LIKE ?
- Parameters passed separately from SQL string

### Security Summary

## Session: 2026-01-25 (Testing Agent - Feature #95 Regression Test)

### Feature #95: Complete forum thread workflow - REGRESSION FOUND AND FIXED

**Regression Identified:**
- ThreadDetailPage.jsx was using localStorage.getItem('user') to get current user
- AuthContext stores user in React state, NOT localStorage
- This caused isOwner to always be false, hiding the 'Marcar como Resuelto' button

**Fix Applied:**
- Added import { useAuth } from '../store/AuthContext';
- Replaced getUser() function with const { user } = useAuth();
- Added String() conversion for user ID comparison (API returns string)

**Verification Steps Completed:**
1. Navigate to course forum - PASS
2. Create new thread with question - PASS
3. Add a reply to the thread - PASS
4. Mark reply as helpful (upvote) - PASS (count: 0 -> 1)
5. Mark thread as resolved - PASS (button now visible after fix)
6. Verify thread shows resolved status - PASS (both in thread detail and forum list)

### Screenshots

   - Error visible and clear

3. **Check aria-live or role alert** - PASS
   - Main error div: Added `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`
   - Email validation error: Added `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"`
   - SVG icons: Added `aria-hidden="true"` to hide decorative icons from screen readers

4. **Verify screen reader announces error** - PASS
   - Playwright accessibility snapshot shows `alert [ref=e123]` for both error types
   - This confirms screen readers will automatically announce errors
   - Tested both server error (invalid login) and inline validation error (invalid email format)

### Implementation Details:

**Files modified:**
- frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx

- `aria-live="assertive"` used for critical errors (login failure) - interrupts screen reader
- `aria-live="polite"` used for inline validation - waits for pause in speech
- ServerErrorBanner and NetworkErrorBanner already had these attributes

### Console Errors: Only expected 401 (not logged in)

### Screenshots:
- feature-217-step1-error-visible.png - Error message visible after invalid login

### Technical Implementation:
- Backend stores all times in ISO 8601 UTC format (e.g., 2026-02-15T20:00:00.000Z)
- Frontend uses JavaScript Intl API:
  - toLocaleTimeString("es-ES", {hour: "2-digit", minute: "2-digit"})
  - toLocaleDateString("es-ES", {weekday: "long", year: "numeric", month: "long", day: "numeric"})
- These functions automatically convert UTC to user local timezone
- No additional code changes needed - feature already implemented correctly

### Console Errors: Only WebSocket reconnection (expected, unrelated to timezone)

- SQL ORDER BY on datetime columns works correctly
- Webinars: ORDER BY scheduled_at ASC
- Forum: ORDER BY created_at DESC (newest) or ASC (oldest)

**Frontend (already implemented correctly):**
- WebinarsPage.jsx uses: .sort(([a], [b]) => new Date(a) - new Date(b)) for calendar grouping
- Date parsing uses JavaScript Date constructor which handles UTC correctly
- toLocaleDateString and toLocaleTimeString convert to user's local timezone

### Console Errors: None

### Screenshots:

- Solution: Modified handleLogout in Navbar.jsx to navigate to home FIRST, then call logout
- Code Change: navigate('/', { replace: true }); await logout();

### Console Errors: Only expected 401s (user not logged in after logout)

## Session: 2026-01-26 (Coding Agent - Feature #55)

### Feature #55: Post-login redirect returns to intended page - VERIFIED AND PASSING

All 4 verification steps completed:

1. **While logged out, navigate to /dashboard** - PASS
   - Clicked Dashboard link while logged out
   - Redirected to /login page
   - Return URL `/dashboard` stored in sessionStorage

2. **Complete login flow** - PASS
   - Used email/password direct login
   - Credentials: instructor@test.com / password123

3. **Verify redirect to /dashboard (not home)** - PASS
   - After successful login, URL is http://localhost:5173/dashboard
   - Dashboard page displayed with "Mi Dashboard" heading
   - sessionStorage cleared after redirect

4. **Repeat with deep link to course** - PASS
   - Navigated to /course/python-fundamentos while logged out
   - Clicked "Inscribirse Gratis" button
   - Redirected to /login with return URL stored
   - After login, redirected back to /course/python-fundamentos
   - Course page displayed with "Python: Fundamentos" and enrollment options

### Implementation Details:
- Updated LoginPage.jsx to read return URL from BOTH sources:
  - URL search params: `searchParams.get('returnUrl')`
  - React Router location state: `location.state?.from`
- Added `loginInitiated` state flag to prevent race condition:
  - Problem: The useEffect for `isAuthenticated` was firing after `refreshAuth()` and clearing sessionStorage before login handler could read it
  - Solution: Set `loginInitiated = true` when login starts, useEffect skips redirect if `loginInitiated` is true
- All three login handlers updated: handleDirectLogin, handleDevLogin, handleLoginWithRizoMa

### Console Errors: 
- Only expected 401 errors from /api/auth/me when not logged in

### Screenshots:

### Feature #61: Category filter in catalog updates URL - VERIFIED AND PASSING

All 6 verification steps completed:

1. **Navigate to course catalog** - PASS
   - Navigated to http://localhost:5173/courses
   - All 6 courses displayed initially

2. **Click on a category filter** - PASS
   - Selected "Programacion" from category dropdown
   - Filter applied immediately

3. **Verify URL updates with filter parameter** - PASS
   - URL changed from /courses to /courses?category=Programacion
   - Fixed race condition where URL wasn't updating due to separate setSearchParams calls

4. **Verify filtered results are shown** - PASS
   - Only "Python: Fundamentos" course displayed (the only Programacion course)
   - Other categories filtered out

5. **Copy URL and open in new tab** - PASS

  - The second call was overwriting the first due to React batching
- Solution: Combined both updates into single call: updateURLParams({ category: value, page: '' })
- Same fix applied to handleLevelChange, handlePriceChange, handleSearchSubmit, handleClearSearch

### Console Errors: Only expected 401s for /api/auth/me (user not logged in)
