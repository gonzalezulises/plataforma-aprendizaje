## Session: 2026-01-26 (Coding Agent - Feature #30)

### Feature #30: XSS prevention in user-generated content - VERIFIED AND PASSING

All 4 verification steps completed:

1. **Submit a forum post with `<script>alert('xss')</script>`** - PASS
   - Created forum thread with XSS payload in title: `XSS Test <script>alert('xss')</script>`
   - Content included multiple XSS vectors:
     - `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
     - `<img src="x" onerror="alert('xss2')">`
     - `<div onclick="alert('xss3')">Click me</div>`

2. **View the rendered post** - PASS
   - Viewed thread in forum list page
   - Viewed thread detail page
   - All content displayed as visible text, not HTML

3. **Verify script is not executed** - PASS
   - No alert dialogs appeared
   - No JavaScript executed from user content
   - Console showed zero XSS-related errors

4. **Verify content is properly escaped or sanitized** - PASS
   - DOM inspection confirmed proper HTML escaping:
     - `<script>` rendered as `&lt;script&gt;`
     - `<img onerror>` rendered as `&lt;img onerror&gt;`
     - `<div onclick>` rendered as `&lt;div onclick&gt;`
   - Zero injected script tags in DOM
   - Zero injected event handlers (onerror, onclick)

### Also tested forum replies with XSS:
- Reply content: `<script>alert('reply-xss')</script>`
- Properly escaped and displayed as text

### Technical Details:
- React's default JSX escaping provides XSS protection automatically
- Content rendered via `{variable}` in JSX is auto-escaped
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` used for user content
- Backend stores raw content; frontend safely renders it
