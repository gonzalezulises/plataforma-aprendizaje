## Session: 2026-01-25 (Agent Session - Feature #155)

### Completed Features
- Feature #155: Rapid forum post clicks handled - VERIFIED AND PASSING
  - All 4 verification steps verified via browser automation:
    1. Write a forum post - PASS
       - Navigated to /course/python-fundamentos/forum
       - Clicked "Nueva Pregunta" button
       - Filled form with TEST_155_RAPID_CLICKS title and content
    2. Click post button multiple times rapidly - PASS
       - Used Playwright dblclick() on "Publicar Pregunta" button
       - Button receives rapid double-click event
    3. Verify only one post created - PASS
       - Navigated to new thread #10 with success toast "Hilo creado exitosamente"
       - Returned to forum page, only ONE TEST_155 thread visible
    4. Check forum for duplicates - PASS
       - API query confirmed only 1 thread with TEST_155 prefix
       - Performed second test with "TEST_155_TRIPLE_CLICK" - also only 1 thread created
       - Total: 2 TEST_155 threads (one per unique test, zero duplicates)

### Technical Implementation
- Frontend uses `useNetworkAwareSubmit` hook for all forum submissions
- Button has `disabled={creating}` attribute (ForumPage.jsx line 345)
- On first click: `isSubmitting` (aliased as `creating`) becomes true immediately
- On subsequent clicks (double-click): button is already disabled, no duplicate submission
- Same pattern used in ThreadDetailPage for reply form (`disabled={submitting}`)

### Code References
- frontend/src/pages/ForumPage.jsx: Lines 24-32 (useNetworkAwareSubmit), Line 345 (disabled={creating})
- frontend/src/pages/ThreadDetailPage.jsx: Lines 30-38 (useNetworkAwareSubmit), Line 482 (disabled={submitting})

### Screenshots
- feature-155-single-thread-created.png - Forum showing single TEST_155 thread after double-click
- feature-155-final-verification.png - Forum showing both TEST_155 threads (one per test, no duplicates)

### Console Errors
- Only WebSocket reconnection errors (expected behavior during initial connection)
- No critical JavaScript errors

### Current Status
- Feature #155 marked as PASSING

[Testing] 2026-01-25 Feature #155 'Rapid forum post clicks handled' verified - PASSED
